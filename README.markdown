Springz - a game without springs...

This is a little game written on a Saturday afternoon, but it's not quite finished yet.

The target of the game is to pick out the stones and if it had some physics
(I'm having troubles including Box2D) the other stones would be pushed
by a bar with a spring (hence the name). If the bar moves too much it's
the next players turn.

The project was written with XCode 4 and MacRuby 0.10.

The app is licensed under MIT and WTFPL.
